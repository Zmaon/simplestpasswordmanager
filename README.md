# The Simplest Password Manager

This is the source code of https://www.simplestpasswordmanager.com/, a very simple "password manager" that generates passwords based on an easy to remember phrase like "My great password for Github". 

The idea is to keep the project as simple as possible, so no server side scripting, no npm, no js compilation, no babel, no webpack, just a few dependencies (bootstrap and jQuery) managed using Bower. 

## Installing

Clone the repo, go in the project's directory and install the dependencies:

    bower install

If you don't have Bower installed on your system, please check their website to see how to install it: https://bower.io

Once it's done, just double-click on `index.html` to open it with your favorite browser, that's it!
